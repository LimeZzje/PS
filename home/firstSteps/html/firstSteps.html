  <h1>Wanna spin like this? </h1>

   <h2>Before we talk about the basics let’s get some FAQ out of the way:</h2>
   
   <h3>„Do I need one of those weird, big pens to get started“?</h3>
   
   <p>No, you can learn your frist tricks with regular pens. No Problem. As soon as you are done learning the fundamentals with a regular pen and you dont HATE learning these tricks, you might want to consider buying (or modding) a proper pen. It´ll make your learning a lot easier</p>
    
    <h3>„Where do I get those pens?“</h3>
    <p>I always encourage beginners to make their own Pens. It´s usually the cheapest way and you get your first modding experience. It´s easy. Just go to your local stationary store, look for a round, doublecapped marker, get some grips and tips from ballpoint pens, put the grips onto the caps of your marker, put the tips inside the grips and DONE! </p>
    <p>Premade pens from Amazon are usually pretty bad spinning and quality wise, sadly. Buying from Amazon should be your last option. </p>
    <p>There are some professional online penspinning-shops but they tend do be a bit pricy. </p>
    <p>Check out the „Penmodding“-section if you want to know more about penmods.</p>
    
    <h3>„Is penspinning hard to learn?“</h3>
    <p>It’s not an easy hobby by any means. You can’t just pick up Penspinning and master it right away. </p>
    <p>You need to learn all tricks one by one and learn to combine them.</p>
    <p>On the bright side, learning new tricks is very fun and it is nice to watch your trick repertoire grow weekly.</p>
    <p>Also, don’t get discouraged by slow progress in the beginning. Patience is key.</p>
    
    <h3>„I don’t think my fingers are flexible enough to do that… “</h3>
    <p>Everybody can learn penspinning. You don‘t need special fingers to be an elite spinner. </p>
    <p>But keep in mind: It might stress your fingers and tendons If you have a very heavy pen, especially in the beginning. It can lead to tendonitis (Google it) if you overdo yourself, so take some breaks inbetween long sessions of spinning.</p>
    
    <h3>…Still here after reading the FAQs? Great! Let’s dive in! </h3>
    <p>Penspinning is a sequence of single tricks, you have to learn one by one in order to combine them into cool „combos“. Terminology is a big topic so you can understand and talk about the actions seen in videos.</p>
